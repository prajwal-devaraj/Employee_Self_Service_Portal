See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design details.

## Quick start with Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:
- Portal: http://localhost:3000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- API health: http://localhost:8000/health

### Demo users

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | admin@peoplehub.dev | Admin123! |
| HR | hr@peoplehub.dev | Hr123456! |
| Manager | manager@peoplehub.dev | Manager123! |
| Employee | employee@peoplehub.dev | Employee123! |

## Local development without Docker

### Backend

```bash
cd services/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp ../../.env.example ../../.env
alembic upgrade head
python -m app.seed
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Useful commands

```bash
make up
make down
make logs
make test
make lint
make seed
```

## Production notes

This repository is production-oriented, but a real company deployment should still:
1. Store secrets in a managed secret manager.
2. Put the application behind TLS and a WAF/reverse proxy.
3. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.
4. Restrict CORS to your real frontend origin.
5. Integrate enterprise SSO (OIDC/SAML), HRIS/payroll providers and object storage.
6. Use managed PostgreSQL/Redis with backups and PITR.
7. Configure alerting, tracing, SLOs and vulnerability/dependency scanning.
8. Review country/state payroll, privacy, retention and labor requirements with counsel.
